# Arduino
This repo contains code that I have written for various Arduino (and compatible) microcontrollers.

_More libraries will be added soon..._

## How to install?
Simply download this repository by clicking _Code>Download ZIP_ from above, and then extract the libraries into your Arduino "libraries" folder. <br/>
If you are using Windows, the path will normally be something like: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Arduino\libraries`.
